NLP_1 and NLP_2 are both PDFs to answer tasks provided by the HyperionDev Bootcamp

NLP_1 are answers to the following questions:

Which type of NLP application applies for each of the following use-cases:

a. A model that allocates which mail folder an email should be sent to
(work, friends, promotions, important), like Gmail’s inbox tabs.
b. A model that helps decide what grade to award to an essay question.
This can be used by a university professor who grades a lot of classes
or essay competitions.
c. A model that provides assistive technology for doctors to provide
their diagnosis. Remember, doctors ask questions, so the model will
use the patients’ answers to provide probable diagnosis for the
doctor to weigh and make decisions.

NLP_2 are answers to the following task:

Read up on any innovative technology using NLP (by companies such as Google or IBM, for instance) and write a brief summary about the technology, what it achieves/does, and an overview of how it works (250 - 500 words).
To take an example, you may have noticed Gmail’s auto-response suggestions on your incoming emails. 
If I send an email to your Gmail address asking for an appointment, on opening the mail you would notice Gmail’s automatically suggested response options such as “Yes, that works for me” and “Sorry, I’m not available at that time.”
